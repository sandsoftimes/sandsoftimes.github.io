I"<p>Lately i was faced this issue on linux mint search menu. I personally use the Windows Key shortcut to open up the start menu and search for the applications from there, usually i pin the most used apps in the start. 
Recently when i was using the menu, i saw this thing of recently opened files displaying there. I mean those files which you used earlier in the past 7 days appear at start and can my disturb your workflow of opening multiple applications.</p>

<p>Gadly i’ve found a solution for it. Simply follow the guide-line. First of all press window button and search for system settings. It will look like this,</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/clt/" alt="1" /></p>

<p>Then in the preferences section, go to privacy, you’ll see these options,</p>

<p>2</p>

<p>Simply turn off the first option of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">remember recently accessed files</code>,</p>

<p>3</p>

<p>and you are done, your recently opened files will not contradict with the pre-added shortcuts via alphabet typing.</p>
